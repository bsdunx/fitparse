fitparse segfaults on getopts loop

****
SOLVE LIBRARY MESS

OPTIONS:

laps: add, don't add (gpx)
non-contiguous: fill, ignore, seperate (trkseg)





* gpx write - mostly done, modulo laps and metadata time
* fix Makefile

activity clean/verify points - a lot is done
  - verify should add to errors
  - confirm summary data is correct if present in file

activity_get_summary function (should have laps?)
garmin smart record/hwm
activity laps
command line client
PROPER TESTS - need a test script?

additional fixes (gaps, hr, power)
tcx + fit data

merge + split
tss/bike power etc
better HR, power model, etc

document the code
look into ReadTheDocs or ronn

rolling averages data calculation:
- takes 2n additional space:
  - one array holds the 1,2,3,...n second average results
  - other array is of pointers used for computation - starts with '1 second averages' = copy of the column vector
      - A[i] = pointer to start of j second window including the point at
  - next is the idea that the 5 second best comes from one of the 4 second windows plus one value on one of the sides

CHECK:
make sure units are all correct
