* gpx write - mostly done, modulo laps and metadata time
* fix Makefile

activity clean/verify points - a lot is done
  - verify should add to errors
  - confirm summary data is correct if present in file

activity_get_summary function (should have laps?)
garmin smart record/hwm
activity laps
command line client
PROPER TESTS - need a test script?

additional fixes (gaps, hr, power)
tcx + fit data

merge + split
tss/bike power etc
better HR, power model, etc

document the code
look into ReadTheDocs or ronn
